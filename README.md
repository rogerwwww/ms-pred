ICEBERG predicts spectra at the level of molecular fragments, whereas SCARF predicts spectra at the level of chemical formula. In order to fairly compare various spectra models, we implement a number of baselines and alternative models using equivalent settings across models (i.e., same covariates, hyeprparmaeter sweeps for each, etc.):

## Install & setup <a name="setup"></a>

Install and set up the conda environment using [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):

```
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate ms-gen
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py develop
```
Note: if you are using GPU, please uncomment the CUDA-based packages for DGL and comment the CPU package in ``envorinment.yaml``.


## Quickstart <a name="quickstart"></a>

To make predictions, we have released and made public a version of SCARF and ICEBERG both trained upon the CANOPUS dataset (renamed NPLIB1 for clarity in corresponding manuscripts). This can be downloaded and used to predict a set of 100 sample molecules contained in the NIST library, as included at `data/spec_datasets/sample_labels.tsv` (test set):

 
```
# Scarf quickstart
. quickstart/scarf/download_model.sh
. quickstart/scarf/run_model.sh

# Iceberg quickstart
. quickstart/iceberg/download_model.sh
. quickstart/iceberg/run_model.sh
```

Model outputs will be contained in `quickstart/{model}/out/`. **We note that this model may be less performant than the model trained on the commercial NIST20 Library. Download links to models trained on NIST20 models are available upon request to any users with a NIST license.**  ICEBERG assigns intensities to various fragment masses. Refer to `notebooks/scarf_demo.ipynb` and `notebooks/iceberg_demo.ipynb` for a walkthrough on how to process and interpret the output dictionary.

Please note models have been updated since the original release to correct for a small error in the adduct masses for `[M-H2O+H]+` and should be re-downloaded.


## Data <a name="data"></a>

A data subset from the GNPS database can first be downloaded and older sirius
outputs and magma runs removed. It will create ``data/spec_datasets/canopus_train_public``, 
where CANOPUS is an earlier name of the GNPS dataset, as explained in our ICEBERG paper.

```
. data_scripts/download_gnps.sh
```

Structural data splits can be established with `data_scripts/make_splits.py`, and the following command will create all splits in bulk:

```
. data_scripts/all_create_splits.sh
```
Please note that ``nist20`` is a commercial dataset. If you do not have access to ``nist20``, please comment the corresponding 
lines in ``data_scripts/all_create_splits.sh`` or you will see file not found errors - not an issue!

### SCARF Processing

Data should then be assigned to subformulae files using
`data_scripts/forms/assign_subformulae.py`, which will preprocess the data. We
produce two fragment versions of the molecule, `magma_subform_50` and
`no_subform`. The former strictly labels subformula based upon smiles structure
and the latter is permissive and allows all entries to pass. The following
script does this for both `canopus_train_public` and `nist20` if it has been
acquired and parsed (commercial dataset).

```
. data_scripts/all_assign_subform.sh
```


### ICEBERG Processing

In addition to building processed subformulae, to train ICEBERG, we must
annotate substructures and create a labeled dataset over the breakage process, 
which we do with the MAGMa algorithm.

This can be done with the following script, specifying an appropriate dataset:

```
. data_scripts/dag/run_magma.sh
```


### Retrieval

To conduct retrieval experiments, libraries of smiles must be created. A PubChem
library is converted and each chemical formula is mapped to (smiles, inchikey)
pairs. Subsets are selected for evaluation.  Making formula subsets takes longer
(on the order of several hours, even parallelized) as it requires converting
each molecule in pubchem to a mol / InChi. 

```
source data_scripts/pubchem/01_download_smiles.sh
python data_scripts/pubchem/02_make_formula_subsets.py
python data_scripts/pubchem/03_dataset_subset.py --dataset-labels data/spec_datasets/nist20/labels.tsv # for nist20 dataset
python data_scripts/pubchem/04_make_retrieval_lists.py
```

To quickly download tables for canopus:  

```

cd data/spec_datasets/canopus_train_public/
wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/7zr6euhuhz3ohi9/retrieval_tbls.tar
tar -xvf retrieval_tbls.tar

```

## Experiments <a name="experiments"></a>


### SCARF

SCARF models trained in two parts: a prefix tree generator and an intensity predictor. The pipeline for training and evaluating this model can be accessed in `run_scripts/scarf_model/`. The internal pipeline used to conduct experiments can be followed below:

1. *Train scarf model*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/01_run_scarf_gen_train.sh`
2. *Sweep number of prefixes to generate*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/02_sweep_scarf_gen_thresh.py`  
3. *Use model 1 to predict model 2 training set*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/03_scarf_gen_predict.sh`   
4. *Train intensity model*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/04_train_scarf_inten.sh`
5. *Make and evaluate intensity predictions*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/05_predict_form_inten.py`

8. *Export scarf forms* `run_scripts/scarf_model/08_export_forms.py`


Instead of running in batched pipeline model, individual gen training, inten
training, and predict calls can be  made using the following scripts respectively:

2. *Sweep over the number of fragments to generate*: `run_scripts/dag_model/02_sweep_gen_thresh.py`     
3. *Use model 1 to predict model 2 training set*: `run_scripts/dag_model/03_run_dag_gen_predict.sh`   
4. *Train intensity model*: `run_scripts/dag_model/04_train_dag_inten.sh`   
5. *Make and evaluate intensity predictions*: `run_scripts/dag_model/05_predict_dag_inten.py`  
6. *Run retrieval*: `run_scripts/dag_model/06_run_retrieval.py`  
7. *Time iceberg*: `run_scripts/dag_model/07_time_dag.py`  
8. *Export dag predictions* `run_scripts/dag_model/08_export_preds.py`  


Instead of running in batched pipeline model, individual gen training, inten
training, and predict calls can be  made using the following scripts respectively:

1. `python src/ms_pred/dag_pred/train_gen.py`
2.  `python src/ms_pred/dag_pred/train_inten.py`
3.  `python src/ms_pred/dag_pred/predict_smis.py`

### GRAFF-MS 

We include a baseline variation of GRAFF-MS in which we utilize a fixed formula vocabulary. We note we do not include collision energy or machines as covariates for consistency with our other implemented models and data processing pipelines, which may affect performance. In addition, because our data does not contain isotopic or varied adduct formula labels, we replace the marginal peak loss with a cosine similarity loss. Pleases see the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11419) to better understand the release details.

### CFM-ID

CFM-ID is a well-established fragmentation-based mass spectra prediction model. We include brief instructions for utilizing this tool below

Build docker: 
```
docker pull wishartlab/cfmid:latest
```

Make prediction:
```
. run_scripts/cfm_id/run_cfm_id.py
. run_scripts/cfm_id/process_cfm.py
. run_scripts/cfm_id/process_cfm_pred.py
```


### Freq baselines

As an addiitonal baseline to compare to the generative portion of our scarf
(thread), we include frequency baselines for generating form subsets:

```
. run_scripts/freq_baseline/predict_freq.py
. run_scripts/freq_baseline/predict_rand.py
```


## Analysis <a name="analysis"></a>

Analysis scripts can be found in `analysis` for evaluating both formula
predictios `analysis/form_pred_eval.py` and spectra predictions
`analysis/spec_pred_eval.py`.

Additional analyses used for figure generation were conducted in `notebooks/`.

## Augmentation <a name="augmentation"></a>

A common use case for forward spectrum prediction models is to use the trained model as a surrogate model for augmenting an inverse model (e.g., [MIST](http://github.com/samgoldman97/mist/)). An example workflow for doing this is shown in `run_scripts/iceberg_augmentation`. The target dataset including a labels file, spectrum files, split, and target augmetnation file for prediction should first be coppied into the `data/spec_datasets`. Once this is complete, the runscripts folder can be copied, modified to use the datset of interest, and run. The ideal output will be a single MGF and labels files including the ouptut predictions.
